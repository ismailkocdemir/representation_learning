### Representation Learning

experimenting with supervised/self-supervised algorithms, contrastive methods and VAEs.

- learning a joint embedding for images and word embeddings that are visually descriptive exclusively.
- using STNs in contrastive methods for learning optimal cropping/augmentation strategy. 
- using STNs in VAE for dynamic and disjoint inference on different parts of the image
